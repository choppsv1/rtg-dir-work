I have been selected as the Routing Directorate reviewer for this draft. The Routing Directorate seeks to review all routing or routing-related drafts as they pass through IETF last call and IESG review, and sometimes on special request. The purpose of the review is to provide assistance to the Routing ADs. For more information about the Routing Directorate, please see â€‹http://trac.tools.ietf.org/area/rtg/trac/wiki/RtgDir

Although these comments are primarily for the use of the Routing ADs, it would be helpful if you could consider them along with any other IETF Last Call comments that you receive, and strive to resolve them through discussion or by updating the draft.

Summary:
========

    [ ] No issues found. This document is ready for publication.

    [ ] This document is basically ready for publication, but has nits that
    should be considered prior to publication.

    [ ] I have some minor concerns about this document that I think should be
    resolved before publication.

    [ ] I have significant concerns about this document and recommend that the
    Routing ADs discuss these issues further with the authors.

Comments:
=========

    Please supply an overview of the draft quality and readability.

    Include anything else that you think will be helpful toward understanding
    your review.

Major Issues:
=============

    Major issues are the type of concerns that will result in the document being
    blocked until they are resolved. The Routing ADs will become involved.

    Please include all of the major issues you have found. Give as much context
    information as possible (e.g., section numbers, paragraph counts).

    If you find no major issues, please write: "No major issues found."


Minor Issues:
=============

    Minor issues are concerns about clarity or technical accuracy that should be
    discussed and resolved before publication, but which would normally be
    resolved between the authors and the reviewers.

    Please include all of the minor issues you have found. Give as much context
    information as possible (e.g., section numbers, paragraph counts).

    If you find no minor issues, please write: "No minor issues found."

Nits:
=====

    Nits are editorial or layout items. They are things that would ideally be
    resolved before publication to make the document more readable, and may be
    raised now to save the RFC Editor work.

    Usually a reviewer will not be looking for this type of issue, but may find
    some in the course of their review.

    Please try to avoid raising esoteric questions of English usage. The RFC
    Editor will spot these, and it is not a wise use of time to discuss these
    things.

    If you find no nits, please leave this section out.
