Subject: RtgDir review (initial): draft-ietf-ospf-ttz-03

Hello,

I have been selected as the Routing Directorate reviewer for this draft. The Routing Directorate seeks to review all routing or routing-related drafts as they pass through IETF last call and IESG review, and sometimes on special request. The purpose of the review is to provide assistance to the Routing ADs. For more information about the Routing Directorate, please see ​http://trac.tools.ietf.org/area/rtg/trac/wiki/RtgDir

Although these comments are primarily for the use of the Routing ADs, it would be helpful if you could consider them along with any other IETF Last Call comments that you receive, and strive to resolve them through discussion or by updating the draft.

Intended Status: Experimental

Summary:
========

    I have some concerns about this document and recommend that the
    Routing ADs discuss these issues further with the authors.

Comments:
=========

    While I believe that the document is for the most part readable and
    understandable, I believe it still requires better or more definitions,
    clarifications, and/or additional text before becoming an RFC.

Major Issues:
=============

[section "2.  Terminology"]

    - An edge router is defined as a router with internal and external adjacencies.
    (and referred to this way later in the text as well). Is this the actual
    definition or is it instead when a router has links that are and are not
    configured as TTZ internal? This makes a big difference b/c the former case
    is very dynamic while the latter is static. One could imagine in the former
    case that a router is configured to be within a TTZ and then by virtue of
    who it becomes adjacent with determines whether it is internal or edge.
    While this makes configuration very simple I think it also has a big impact
    on the complexity of the protocol interactions.

    After reading section 11.1 "Configuring TTZ" which proposes "some options
    for configuring a TTZ", it certainly seems that the intention is for links
    to be determined to be within a TTZ or not based only on configuration. If
    this is indeed the case I think this needs to be stated up front and very
    clearly, and I would suggest changing all the text in "2. Terminology" to
    talk about configuration instead of adjacencies. For example:

    "TTZ link or TTZ internal link: a link configured to be inside the TTZ."

    "TTZ external link: a link not configured to be within a TTZ"

    "TTZ internal router: a router configured with only TTZ internal links."

    "TTZ external router: a router with no configured TTZ internal links"

    "TTZ edge router: a router configured with both TTZ internal and TTZ
    external links."

[section "7.  Constructing LSAs for TTZ" paragraph 6 and 7]

   ... "The cost of the link is the cost of the shortest path from this TTZ edge
   router to the other TTZ edge router within the TTZ."

   "In addition, the LSA may contain a third group of links, which are the stub
   links for the loopback addresses inside the TTZ to be accessed by nodes
   outside of the TTZ."

   - So basically every SPF from a TTZ internal topology change can lead to new
   edge router LSAs being advertised throughout the area to adjust the "virtual"
   routing link costs. This is noteworthy because while you've hidden state
   using the TTZ, the dynamics of the network haven't gotten simpler rather
   they've gotten more complex, as changes are now cascading rather than being
   singular. This is an interesting trade-off choosing perpetual run-time and
   protocol complexity in order to avoid the one time cost of new area creation.
   Would it be worth actually pointing out these costs of using TTZ?

[section "7.  Constructing LSAs for TTZ" paragraph 8]

     "To migrate to a TTZ smoothly, a TTZ edge router virtualizes the TTZ in two
     steps. At first, the router updates its normal router LSA by adding a
     point-to-point link to each of the other edge routers of the TTZ and a stub
     link for each of the loopback addresses in the TTZ to be accessed outside
     of the TTZ into the LSA. And then it removes the links configured as TTZ
     links from its updated router LSA after sending its updated router LSA and
     receiving the updated router LSAs originated by the other TTZ edge routers
     for MaxLSAAdvTime or after sending its updated router LSA for
     MaxLSAGenAdvTime (refer to Appendix A)."

   In order to be sure I understood this I basically broke it apart and put it together
   again with possibly incorrect reductions. I ended up with:

     To migrate to a TTZ smoothly, a TTZ edge router virtualizes the TTZ in two steps:

     Step 1: The router updates its router LSA by adding a point-to-point link
     to each of the other known edge routers in the TTZ, and also by adding the
     stub links advertised by TTZ internal routers.

     Step 2: After RMaxLSAAdvTime (.1 seconds) or MaxLSAGenAdvTime (.3 seconds)
     remove the TTZ links from its router LSA.

[section "10.  Computation of Routing Table"

   The text says to ignore *all* links from a TTZ edge routers router LSA. This
   presumably works b/c the SPF is also going to use the advertised TTZ Router
   LSA instead. Shouldn't the fact that the SPF should using the new TTZ Router
   LSA be stated somewhere as well?

Minor Issues:
=============

[section: "Introduction" 2nd paragraph]

    The initial sentence makes an assertion about complexity and time
    consumption for area creation. The following sentence does not back this
    assertion up but merely describes the act of creating a new area. I found
    this less than compelling.

[section: "2. Terminology"]

    This need not be addressed here but it's where I had the question: Can a
    TTZ edge router be in more than one TTZ?

[section "5.1.  Overview of Topology-Transparent Zone" 3rd paragraph ]

    "In addition to having the functions of an OSPF area", is this actually the
    case? That is, is a TTZ really a superset of OSPF area functionality? I'm
    pretty sure it is not.

[section "5.1.  Overview of Topology-Transparent Zone" Bullet 1]

   "o  An OSPF TTZ is virtualized as the TTZ edges connected each other."

   This is a very important bullet as it actually will describe what a TTZ
   really is. As such I'd suggest more precise text here. For example:

   "o An OSPF TTZ represents a set of TTZ internal routers as a full mesh of
   virtual links between the TTZ edge routers."

   ?

[section "5.1.  Overview of Topology-Transparent Zone" Bullet 2]

   "An OSPF TTZ receives the link state information about the
   topology outside of the TTZ, stores the information in the TTZ and floods the
   information through the TTZ to the routers outside of the TTZ."

   This bullet is a bit clunky to read. Perhaps something more direct like:

   "Non-TTZ link state information is handled as normal (i.e., it is not
   filtered or modified by a TTZ)"

   If you want to keep the original text then a couple nits:

   "An OSPF TTZ receives" => "TTZ Routers receive"

   "stores the information in the TTZ and floods" => "store the information, and flood"

[section: "6.1.  General Format of TTZ LSA" paragraph 3]

   "A TTZ LSA having an optional TTZ Router TLV is called a TTZ Router LSA. A TTZ
   LSA containing a TTZ Options TLV is called a TTZ Control LSA."

   Can these ever be combined? By naming them distinctly like this, it seems to
   be exclusive, if this is the case that should probably be more clearly
   defined.

   In general I think more expansion and clarity here is in order. Instead of
   talking about LS Type 10/9 with a note about type 10. Why not discuss each type:
   - LS Type 9 "Link local scope" when it is used, and what is optional and mandatory in it.
   - LS Type 10 "Area scope" when it is used, and what is optional and mandatory in it.

[section "6.3.  TTZ Router TLV" paragraph 1]

   "The format of a TTZ Router TLV is as follows.  It contains the
   contents of a router LSA."

   Is this trying to say:

   "It has the same content as a standard OSPF Router LSA (RFC x-ref) with the
   following modifications"?

[section "6.3.  TTZ Router TLV" TLV content]

   Given the existence of the TLV-Length, is the "# links" field redundant? What
   happens if they correctly correlate?

[section "6.4.  TTZ Options TLV" "flags"]

   So "exclusive" => "mutually exclusive"?

   If this is the case these aren't really flags but rather one of 4 possible
   values (I believe in the all 0 case the TLV is not advertised?), and if so it
   would be much better to simply define the 4 possible values using 2 bits.

   What happens if more than one bit is set to 1?

[section "7.  Constructing LSAs for TTZ" paragraph 3]

   This text can be read to indicate that for TTZ internal routers the router's
   normal Router LSA content is copied into a TTZ Router TLV, does the router
   also advertise its Router LSA as normal or is that then suppressed? It's not
   clear to me why this information needs copying, and so I'm wondering if the
   text is saying that no TTZ Router TLV is included, and that the TTZ internal
   router just advertises it's regular OSPF Router LSA.

   The text could be more explicit. Also some of my confusion stems from earlier
   defining a "TTZ Router LSA" as one containing an "optional TTZ Router TLV".
   So when the text here refers to the LSA as a TTZ Router LSA one might assume
   that the optional TTZ Router TLV must be present.

   Perhaps this gets back to my want for better separating and defining
   the LS Types and contents.

[section "7.  Constructing LSAs for TTZ" paragraph 4 and 9]

   "After receiving a trigger to migrate to TTZ such as a TTZ LSA with
   flag M = 1, a TTZ edge router originates its normal router LSA for
   virtualizing a TTZ, which comprises three groups of links in general."

   "To roll back from a TTZ smoothly after receiving a trigger to roll
   back from TTZ, ..."

   - Triggers are mentioned a few times throughout the text. I think the
     triggers meaning, rather than being initially implied, should be explicit
     defined early and in 1 location. It isn't until section 11.2 that I thought
     I understood what triggers were and how they worked.

     Actually the triggers are defined in section 6.4, but the text there never
     actually uses the word "trigger". I suggest that this be changed so that it
     is clear what a trigger is prior to the use of the term.

[section "8.1.  Discover TTZ Neighbors" paragraph 2]

   "If two ends of the link have different TTZ IDs, no TTZ adjacency over
   the link will be "formed"."

   - In general I'm somewhat confused about the actual definition of a TTZ
     adjacency. How does it compare to a normal protocol adjacency. In the above
     case you would have a protocol adjacency I believe, but no TTZ adjacency?
     How is this link advertised if the router is a TTZ edge router?

[section "8.1.  Discover TTZ Neighbors" paragraph 5]

   The text talks about when (Z==0 and there is a TTZ LSA with T=1) or Z==1. Where
   are all the places that T=1 is showing up? What about the case when an
   adjacency is forming when M=1 instead of T=1?

[section "8.1.  Discover TTZ Neighbors" paragraph 7]

   Since the diagram state Zs are the same, it no longer applies to the rest of
   section 8. Is it worthwhile to have a new diagram here for clarity?

[section "8.1.  Discover TTZ Neighbors" paragraph 8]

   Here's a mention of "triggers B to migrate", I think you probably should
   state explicitly what this means, which I *think* is:

   "A also sends a D-LSA containing a TTZ Control TLV with M=1 to B, triggering
   it to migrate."

   Although this now makes me wonder what does B do on receiving M=1 if it had
   not received or been configured for T=1 yet?

[section "8.1.  Discover TTZ Neighbors" paragraph 9]

   I would break this paragraph up to make clear that 2 distinct things are
   happening based on 2 different events. So:

   "When B receives the D-LSA from A and determines they have the same
   TTZ ID but its Z=0 and A's Z=1, B sends A all the TTZ LSAs it has and
   starts to migrate to TTZ after receiving A's D-LSA with M=1.  After
   migration to TTZ, B updates and advertises its LSAs as needed."

   becomes:

   "When B receives the D-LSA from A and determines they have the same
   TTZ ID but its Z=0 and A's Z=1, B sends A all the TTZ LSAs it has."

   "When B receives the D-LSA from A with M=1 it starts to migrate to TTZ. After
   migration to TTZ, B updates and advertises its LSAs as needed."

   Does "starts to migrate" here simply means B starts setting it's M=1 as
   well?

   What exactly is happening for B to go from "starts to migrate" to "After
   migration"? I believe this is indicated by Z=0 transitioning to Z=1 (is the
   TTZ Control TLV with M=1 also removed from the D-LSA?)

   What LSAs are being updated and advertised by B here?

[section "8.1.  Discover TTZ Neighbors" paragraph 10]

   "After receiving B's D-LSA with Z=1, A updates and sends B its D-LSA
   by removing the Options TLV.  It also updates and advertises its LSAs
   as needed."

   What LSAs are being updated and advertised by A here?

[section "8.1.  Discover TTZ Neighbors" in general]

   Are D-LSA sent periodically, if so how often, if not when precisely are they
   sent?

   What happens when B changes its TTZ ID or doesn't send a D-LSA?

[section "8.1.  Discover TTZ Neighbors" Broadcast and NBMA part (i.e., paragraph 11+)]

[section "8.1.  Discover TTZ Neighbors" paragraph 12]

   So the mis-configured router behavior is dependent on when the mis-configured
   router is introduced? If introduced prior to any adjacency formation then its
   presence will keep all routers from becoming TTZ adjacent, otherwise only
   itself will not have become TTZ adjacent?

   What does mis-configured mean, a different TTZ ID? What about the lack of the
   receipt of a D-LSA on the link? How long does the DR wait for receipt of a
   D-LSA from each neighbor before deciding it won't be receiving one and the
   neighbor is not configured on this link as part of TTZ?

[section "8.1.  Discover TTZ Neighbors" last paragraph]

   Is this just saying: "routers only TTZ discover after forming a normal
   adjacency"?

[section "9.1.  Advertisement of LSAs within TTZ" paragraph 2]

   "Any network LSA generated for a broadcast or NBMA network in a TTZ is
   advertised within the TTZ."

   [nit: And not outside? This is explicit for the router LSA.]

   What happens when a DR has a mis-configured router on a broadcast network and
   thus is not forming a TTZ adjacency with it? It still has a normal adjacency
   right? So it no has a network LSA that includes both TTZ and non-TTZ routers
   where does it advertise this network LSA?

[section "11.2.  Smooth Migration to TTZ" paragraph 5]

   I was confused by many mentions earlier in the document to a router migrating
   to a TTZ. I think what paragraph 5 in section 11.2 is saying (in too many
   words) is this:

   "Migrating to a TTZ" means a router advertises a TTZ Control TLV with M=1. A
   router "Migrates to a TTZ" either when configured to do so or when it
   receives a TTZ Control TLV with M=1.

   If this is the case then I think something like the above text should occur
   earlier in the document.

[section "11.3.  Adding a Router into TTZ" paragraph 3]

   I don't understand the intent of this paragraph. Is it just saying that if
   TTZ is configured on a link between 2 non-adjacent routers, when they
   eventually become adjacent they will also form a TTZ adjacency?

[section "13.  Security Considerations"]

   This seems a bit weak or perhaps just wrong. Perhaps better would be to say
   that TTZ relies on the OSPF security mechanisms in place and has the same
   security threat surface?

   On the use of parenthesis, the text is using parenthesis as a form of
   grouping as one might in mathematics which I'm not sure is proper.
   Parenthesis in writing are generally used as an aside. Probably the clearest
   way to indicate the logical grouping would be to use a list, e.g.,
