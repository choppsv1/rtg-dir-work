I have been selected as the Routing Directorate reviewer for this draft. The
Routing Directorate seeks to review all routing or routing-related drafts as
they pass through IETF last call and IESG review, and sometimes on special
request. The purpose of the review is to provide assistance to the Routing ADs.
For more information about the Routing Directorate, please see
â€‹http://trac.tools.ietf.org/area/rtg/trac/wiki/RtgDir

Although these comments are primarily for the use of the Routing ADs, it would
be helpful if you could consider them along with any other IETF Last Call
comments that you receive, and strive to resolve them through discussion or by
updating the draft.

Intended Status: Informational

Summary:
========

    This document is basically ready for publication, but has 1 minor issue and
    various nits that should be considered prior to publication.

Comments:
=========

    I found the draft fairly well written, easy to understand with good
    references. I believe that after fixing the minor issue and nits,
    this informational draft will be ready for publication. This was the
    first TEAS draft I have reviewed, and as a result it may mean that
    my review is less in depth than others.

Major Issues:
=============

    No major issues found.


Minor Issues:
=============

    1. 3rd paragraph: First sentence doesn't parse for me, i.e., I can't figure
       out what this means:

           "In GMPLS end-to-end recovery schemes generally considered,
           restoration..."

       Is it trying to say:

           "When considering GMPLS end-to-end recovery schemes, the
           restoration..."?

       or

           "Generally GMPLS end-to-end recovery schemes have the restoration..."

       or

            ...?
